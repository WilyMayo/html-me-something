    <p> Another typical Monday in the beautiful city of Miami beach. Where the sun seems to always be shining and the streets always filled with crazy tourists wearing fanny packs. 
        The home the largest cruise ship port in the world, and also where many celebrities come to visit it. Why you wonder? Why would anyone want to leaving this paradise of a place? Well when you live a place for a while, the everyday routine becomes boring.

    <p> That's when it came to me, I need to get away from this place and see what's out there. The first thing I decide to do was search where is somewhere I dreamed of going. The place that come to mind was Las Angeles, California.  Thats it, I called a uber to get me to the airport and I was off. </p>

    <p> When the plane landed I feel the cool refreshing air that surround the place. The people seemed more pleasant like there wasnâ€™t really anywhere impotent they need to be, unlike Miami. Now I was hungry, so the number one place in list was the famous In and Out burger. Now I know everyone is skeptical about In and Out ridicules low price and how fast they pump out those burgers but believe when I say it. They are awesome.

         Now I was reenergized and ready to check the high points that LA had to offer. I was told the most intereseting place to be was vince Beach. 
         Right away the first thing that grabs your eyes is muscle beach. Which we all seen the youtube videos of beefy cut guys working up a sweat at this pulled together, backyeard, beach-view so called gym.
         If that doesn't blow you the street preformers will. The board walk was cover with shops and anyone with a talent trying to make a extra buck.
